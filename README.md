# Example: Distributed Provenance-Aware Workflow using Distributed Step Crate Extension

This repository provides an example of a **Distributed Provenance-Aware Workflow**, using the **Distributed Step Crate extension** applied to the **Provenance Run Crate** specification. It is implemented in the context of a real production Workflow Management System (WMS): **Globus Flows**.

```

Each **Distributed Step Crate** corresponds to a granular step in the overall workflow, executed independently via Globus Flows and collated within an Orchestration Node. The full **Provenance Run Crate** extension integrates these **Distributed Step Crates** to provide a contiguous provenance record of the distributed workflow's run.

## 🌐 Web Preview

This repository includes a minimal [GitHub Pages](https://gusellerm.github.io/distributed-provenance-example/) site to preview the RO-Crate visualizations via `ro-crate-preview.html`.

---

## ✅ Validation Summary

A structured comparison has been performed between the **Provenance Run Crate** and the **Distributed Provenance Crate**, using `comparator.py`.

Results are viewable on the [Validation Summary Page](https://gusellerm.github.io/distributed-provenance-example/validation-summary.html) and include:

- Entity shape comparisons between crates
- Validation of structural relationships and constraints as defined in `validation_rules.json`
